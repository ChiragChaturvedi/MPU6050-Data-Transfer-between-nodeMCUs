# MPU6050-Data-Transfer-between-nodeMCUs
A Guide on how to send sensor data between multiple nodes 

In this project we use UDP communication for sending data from one node to another.
The initial MPU6050 sensor data is taken from an Arduino UNO or Nano and is sent to an nodeMCU, and from there it is sent to the master node.
